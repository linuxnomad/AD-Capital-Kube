# Setting up config and building Machine Agent DaemonSet from Dockerfile

Once that you have verified your installation of kubernetes, the next step is to
deploy an app to that cluster. To download the source code needed, clone this specific branch with

```
git clone https://github.com/linuxnomad/AD-Capital-Kube.git
```

Ensure that the correct files were downloaded. You should see a a few folders, but the most important
is the folder:
```
Kubernetes/
```
All of the Appdynamics agent configuration variables need to be set in:
```
Kubernetes/env-configmap.yaml
```
Fill in your controller variables in that file. 

Once you have done that you need to put in the AppDynamics customer name and accesskey in the secret.yaml file.
```
Kubernetes/secret.yaml
```
These values need to be base64 encoded. Using the terminal type:
```
echo -n <accesskey> | base64
echo -n <customername> | base64
```
That command will give you the base64 encoded version of your value. Those agent variables are being consumed in the deployments for approval, rest, processor, portal, verification and the daemon set monitor.

The other thing that is important here, is that if you want to include the Kubernetes events extension in the DaemonSet, you are going to need to build the AppDynamics Machine Agent prior to creating your cluster. The image below shows the data that the extension pulls in. To do this, navigate to
```
Agent-Dynamic-Loading/appd-machine
```
If you are using AWS, you need to set the config file which is your kubectl config for accessing the cluster (extension needs this).
```
Agent-Dynamic-Loading/appd-machine/config
```

 The second config file you need to fill out, is config.yml in the KubernetesEventsMonitor folder.
 ```
Agent-Dynamic-Loading/appd-machine/KubernetesEventsMonitor/config.yml
```
 You need to set the following values:
 ```
 # Path to your kubectl Client configuration
kubeClientConfig: "/.kube/config"
 ```
 The API Key value must be generated from the Controller interace. 
 See: https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO45/Managing+API+Keys
 ```
 # The API Key you create needs to be able to Manage and Publish Custom Analytics Events
eventsApiKey: "<APIkeyhere>"
 ```
 ```
 # Global Account Name obtained from
# AppDynamics --> Settings --> License --> Accounts --> Global Account Name
accountName: ""
 ```
 ```
 # Name of your Custom Analytics Events Schema
eventsSchemaName: "kubernetes_events"
 ```
 ```
 # Events Service Endpoint. These Default settings are for SaaS Users. Change if you are on Premise
#eventsUrl: "https://fra-ana-api.saas.appdynamics.com:443"
eventsUrl: "http://hostname:9080"
 ```

Once you have modified all config files run either:
```
docker build -t <yourRepoHere>:<yourTag> .
```
or
```
docker build -t machine-agent-adcapital .
```

Once you've done that make sure you change all instances for the name (if different from previous) to match the image you just built.
```
KubernetesMachineAgent/monitor-deployment.yaml 
```
```
metadata:
  name: machine-agent-adcapital
```
